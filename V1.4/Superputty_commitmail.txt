Add password to the add/edit session dialog.

As of now, user can only give password as "-pw" in the ExtraArgs. Hence adding a dedicated pane for storing the password.

Still the password won't be encrypted in the xml, but when the user wants to edit some session, the password won't be revealed to anyone starring at his monitors :)
